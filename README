Run "th test.lua" to test all the modules in the ggnn and rnn libraries.

To run the bAbI experiments, and experiments on the two extra sequence tasks:
1. go into babi/data, run "bash get_10_fold_data.sh" to get 10 folds of bAbI
   data for 5 tasks (4, 15, 16, 18, 19) and do some preprocessing.
2. go into babi/data/extra_seq_tasks, run "bash generate_10_fold_data.sh" to
   get 10 folds of data for the two extra sequence tasks.
3. go back to babi/ and use run_experiments.py to run the GGNN/GGS-NN
   experiments, e.g. "python run_experiments.py babi18" runs GGNN on bAbI task
   18 for all 10 folds of data.
4. use run_rnn_baselines.py to run RNN/LSTM baseline experiments, e.g.
   "python run_rnn_baselines.py babi18 lstm" runs LSTM on bAbI task 18 for all
   10 folds of data.

Note:
- make sure "./?.lua" and "./?/init.lua" are on your lua path. For example by 
  export LUA_PATH="./?.lua;./?/init.lua;$LUA_PATH"
- the experiment results may differ from what we reported in the paper, as the
  dataset is randomly generated and will be different from run to run.
